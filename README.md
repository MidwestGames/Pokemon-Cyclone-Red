## Pokemon-Cyclone-Red

### This is my attempt to recreate a Pokemon game in Unity.
I started this project because I wanted to play a Pokemon game that you can catch all the Pokemon is the Pokedex. There are ROM hacks that do this, but that is slightly sketchy, so I wanted to make my own game. 

I started looking for the spritesheets for one of the DS generation games, and I found the full spritesheet for Pokemon Black and White. This contains all 600+ Pokemon to that point. 

As of now, I am on a hiatus from the project due to university, but I will be picking it back up in the summer (May-July).
